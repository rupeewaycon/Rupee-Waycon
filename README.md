# Rupee-Waycon
Travel? To live is to travel. I go from one day to another, just like going from one station to another, riding the train of my body or destiny, sticking my head out of the window, looking at the streets, looking at the squares rupeewayconLjtHeadfyinformation.ccFooterLytrupeewaycon, looking at people's faces and gestures. These are always the same, but always different, just like the scenery.
